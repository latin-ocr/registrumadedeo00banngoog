suturis.¹ His forebodings were only too true: things had indeed
gone lrom bad to worss. For some years before 1317, 111 gevem-
ment-so far as there was any government-had been praetioally
in 1111 hands oi Edward’s jealous oouein, Thomas of Lanoaster,¹ a
01111, 1110111001, and violent man, only lese inoompetnnt than ·
Edward himself. Lanoaster’s every aetion was determined by per-
10111 aima and personal grievanoes ; and his selfish, short-sigbted
polioy was as great 1 mislortune to 111 country ae the obstinate
lolly 01 111 King.⁸ In the summer ol 1317, 111 long-standing
differenoes between Edward and his powerful kinsman. had brought
about a state of almost open war. anh had gethered together a
strong 10101, and lor months they lay watohing eaoh other, ready
to light 11 any moment. On the King’s side were only 11100111-
petent iools‚ such as 111 Arohbishop,⁴ or greedy and insolent
favourites like 111 Desponsere. 1111011111, had he been an abler

Montfort. Being what 11 was, a parody rather than 1 iollower
01 111 great Earl, he had only tha adventitious support 01 111
Μ110111 Lords, Humphrey Bohun, John Giffard and the Mortimers‚

who had their own reasons, at times, lor going against 111 King.⁸
Between 111 two faotione stood a middle party-Pembrolre‚ who was
perhaps personally loyal to his kinsman the King, and still oberished
resentment against Lanoaster ior the dishonour done to his word
by the execution, in 1312, 01 Gavestou, though he had Pembrolre's
pledge of saie-conduot; Badlesmere, a bitter personal enemy 01
Earl Thomas ; and D'Amory‚ who sought only to secure, against
Desponser’s greed, his suouession 10 111 Glouoeeter honours. These
three, in the November 01 1111 year, bound themselves by an
indenture to an allianoe ior gaining supreme influendo in the
Royal Gonnoil, as against Lanoaster and the Desponsers alilre.
