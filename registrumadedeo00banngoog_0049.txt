happens, however, that we can test De la Moore in thia point.
For we have in existence the Bishop's own account of this aa
called “ sermon.'' Writing only eight years afterwards, when many
were alive who had been present, and could contradict him if he
mis-stated the case, he says: “By command of the present King,
and the Quaen his mother, in the month of October, in the pre'-
sence of the King, the Duke of Lancaster, and others,I proclaimed
in Oxford the reason of their coming to England, as set forth in
the Letters Patent signed and scaled by them.'’ [He then quotes
the Letters Patent, in which the various wrong-doings of the King,
“ par mavoys counsail '¹ of his favourites, are set forth at length,
including-and here we trace perhaps the Bishop's hand in draw-
ing up the Letters Patent-“ qe les Prelas de seint Eglise sont de
loun biens countre Dieu et dreiture despoilez.’'] “ In introducing
this document, I quoted Gen. iii, 15, ‘Iwill put eumity between
thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall
bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.’ And I applied
the text to Hugh Despenser‚ whose head the ‘woman,’ namely
the Queen-mother, was come to crush. And no sane person could
believe that my words applied to my Lord the King. God is my
witness, and all who were present, that Ι said nothing of the

treason alleged against me.”²

From Oxford the Quaen and her supportare went by way of
Gloucester and Berkeley to Bristol, which was reached on Oct. 26,
the King, with Baldoclr and the younger Despenser‚ having fled
before them to cardias At Bristol the young Edward was pro·
claimed ortator of the kingdom.⁴ Thence the Quaen proceeded to
Hereford, where, says Walsingham,⁸ she stayed about a month.

She lodged with Orleton at the Palace,⁰ and there received the
