The War ia the March. xxiii

Shrnwshmy, however, the King’s men forced the passage of the
rirer. Leucaster, with characteristic incompetence, lingered in the
North, when he ought to have hastened to the Marches to help
his allies.¹ The Mortimers, realizing their own weakness‚ and
resenting Leucaster's apparent desertion ol their cause, opened
negociatione with the King‚ while Herelord end Gilbert Talbot
hastened off “ to tell Leucesiae, with teate, what had been done.”
The King, ii the account given in the Floret Histerramrm is to
be trusted,² promised pardon to the Mortimers; but when, on
Jan. 22, they submitted, pristine promissionis sedere miserabiliter

Going south from Shrewsbury, and taking unopposed possession,
on the march, oi the castles ol Hele, Hodonet‚ Red Castis, Chiris,
Bishop's Castle, Ludlow‚ and Wigmore, Edward reached Herelord
on Jan. 28,l and, summoning the Bishop before him, aeriter

miron in the rising it is difficult to determine. Quite naturally, all
his sympathies were with Mortimer; and it would seem that he
actually senta contingent to help in delending the line oi the
Severn. The story is told in detail at the trial, two years later;
though, since the Bishop declined to recognise a secular tribunal,‘
we have only the statement ol the case for the prosecution.
According to this account, Mortimer began to raise a force of
horse and loct, when first he heard of the siege ol [eeds Oestle.
About Ohn'stmas he was at Bromyard, where his men “ selred
