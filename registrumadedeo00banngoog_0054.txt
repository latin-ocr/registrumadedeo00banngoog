The death os Baidoclr. xli

contending thot the Bishop had no right to possess a prison of
his own within the liberties ol the city, claimed the prisoner, and
carried him off to Newgate.¹ De lo Moore, as a matter of course,
suggests that this was done at the Bishop’s own instigation, in
order that the hardships of the common prison might kill his
viatim. For, as he plausibly argues, Orleton, seeing that he was
now potentissimus prelatus procliuia, solvo dignitate archiepiscopatus,
could quite securely have resisted the Bailiffs’ claim. But it is far
more likely that the Bishop, always a man of sound common sense,
did not care to involve himself in a struggle with the london
citizens for the sake of a shadowy right, when substantial power,
sufficient to content the most ambitione, was already within his
grasp. That he should feel any special desire to save the pitiful
creature who had sold himself asa willing tool to Edward II
and the Despensers was not to be expected. The ex-chancellor
died soon afterwards² (“in torments,” adds De la Moore with his
habitual exaggeratius) and was buried at St. Paul's. Orleton did,
indeed, gain some slight advantage from his death. For, on July
2, he secured from the Pope letters of provision, granting to his
nephew, Thomas de Trilleck,³ the Ganonry and Prebend of wells,

void by the death of Baldock.

Scaroely was the session of Parlinment over than Orleton
resumed his old employment of envoy to the Papcl curia. We
should almost have expected him to have remained at the English
Gonrt, where he now held a leading position. He was the
intimate and trusted friend of Isabella and Mortimer‚⁴ who held in

³-The authorities at Wells had given Baldoclr's Prebend (oi Yattonl to Alan de
conesburah. and it was two years before Th0maa de Trilieclr secured possession. Orleton
himself wrote urrently to Bishop Drolrensford in the matter. and Stratiord also wrote that
he and Orleton. as executore of the Papal provision, would remove Alan de Conesburah
from the stall. without cost to Drolrensford. He berta him. therefore. not to hinder the
Bishopof Worcester's nephew lfor Orleton. by this time. had been translated to worcester)
from certina possession nithe Prehend. Upon this. Bishop Drolrensford writes. on May 29.
1333, to the Dean and Chapter “Thomas de Trilleck. having obtained. by Papal Provision,
the Prebend of Yatton. must receive full possession.'' Thomas. and his brother rohn de
Trilieclr, though both under the canonical age. were already Portionistc of Bromyard; a
few years later both are canons also of Hereford. obtaining in 1333 ''reservation of one of
the canonical houses.” We cannot follow the further fortunes of the brothers. but may
remind the reader that. in 1344, when Thomas Charieton died. dohn de Trilleclr becarm
Bishop oi Hereford.

l-lt is. it must be confessed. somewhat difficolt to understand how a Bishop of the
Church could connire at the adultery of isabella and Mortimer. as Orleton must have done,
if the received story of the relations between the Queen and Mortimer be true. 'l’he same
difficulty meets us in the attitude of flectet, a century and a half earlier. towards the
connection of lienry ll with Rosamund clifford.
