Chapter obtained the King'e 1166166 16 61661 a Biehop in his
plaoe. Wulstan de Braneford, Prior 61 Woroeeter was ohosen;
and, the royal 666611 being obtained on Sept. 8, he received
the temporalitiee on 061. 8. The King—that ie, stratford, who,
from the firet, 11611 been jealoue 61 the “Quaen'e Biehope”—wrote
lettere 1ο the Pope in favour of Braneford, ordered properatione
to be made for his 661666161161, and commanded the Arohbiehop
16 confirm 1116 appointment. The helplese Reynolde, footing equally
the King and the Pope, delayed, procrastinated, and, at 1661,
opportunely died (Nov. 16) without performing the ceremony. The
King then commanded the Chapter of Canterbury to confirm, but
they dealined to do so, for fear 61 the Pope'e diepleasure. John
XXII, meanwhile, ignoring what was going on in England, translated
Orleton to Woroeeter by Papal Bull dated Sept. 28.1 On Orleton'e
return to England, the King addreeeed to him a threatening
letter, prohibiting him from aooepting the Biehoprio of Woroeeter;
and, on Deo. 26, he was summoned to appear before 1116 Ρ61116-
1116111 61 York, to anewer for 1116661161 in obtaining Papal lettere
prejudicial to the King. 11 epita 61 611 this, he obtained the
restitution of the temporalities on March 5, 1328. The appoint-
ment 16 6 biehoprio 11161, 66 now, involved tbe expenditure 616
16136 eum of money in dilapidatione. The estates 61 the Here·
ford See, having been for 66 1613 “ 11 the King'e hande''—a'.a.
handed over 66 6 prey to the Despeneers and their greedy and
rapacious hirelinge, Baldook and Irby—had very considerably
leesened in value, and the 6661 61 the dilapidatione would bave
ruined 1116 Biehop’s finanoial poeition, had nottho Pope, on Nor.

the Prior 61 Llanthony “to do justice touohing the manors and
buildings belonging to 1116 1166116 61 the Biehop of Hereford,
leeeened in value by 1631661 61 the eeoular power and malioe of
ministare, who detained the temporalitiee of Hereford. Biehop
Adam is not 16 be molested on 66661111 61 611611 dilapidation.”

Why Orleton braved the King’e displeasure to obtain 116116-
161161 from Hereford to Woroeeter, 1116 eomewbat difficult to 666,
unless it be that the various menore had indeed been so impover·
ished by the plunder and 1631661 61 the paet three years that the
Biehop saw no reasonable likelihood of obtaining any income from

them. The reaeon given 161 his translation 16 Winehester‚ in the
