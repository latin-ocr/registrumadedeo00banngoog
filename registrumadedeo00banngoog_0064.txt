The Ohorocter of Orlefon. li

——-——- ι·- -οη

It may quite possibly be true, as Stubbs says, that there
was in the reign of Edward Il “ a miserable level of political

selfiahness which marks, without exception, every public man”-
though, surely, even letting judgmeut against Orletou go by delault,
neither Pembroke, nor Henry of Lancaster, nor Archbisbop Melton
can, on any showing, justly be called selhsh. But, if wawere to
grant that Stubbs is correct in hia sweeping statement, we might
at any rate claim that Orleton was no worse than the rest. He
was quite certainly not the malignant und merciless monsterol
De la Moore's highly-coloured picture. I venture to doubt whether
he was even the ‘'vindictive prolate,” “rnalicious ae ever,” of
Stubbs' sketch. One thing, in any case, is beyond disputa. Ii
he was a good hater, he was also a firm friend. He suffered for
the Mortimers when they were weak, when nothing seemed less
likely than their triumph. Through years of all but abject poverty
and disgrace, he worked and schemed for Mortimer. And ten
years after the death of his friend, he rushed once again into the
fiercest of the strife, old and blind though he was, iu the hope of

taking vengeance upon one of Mortimer’s triumphant locs. But if
a man resolutely chooses his side, works for it zealously, clinga

to it when it falls-above all, il he suffera for it, it is not uu·
mingled blame that he deserves. And Orleton beyond doubt
suffered for his choise, both before and after the King's death.
Though vastly ahler than stratford—not to mention Meopham or
Reynclds—he failed to reach the Archbishopric, which they ob·
tained, because he had not Stratiord’s art of following, not guiding
events--of leciug both ways until the trend of things was unmis·
takeable. Orleton deliberately preferred to make history rather μ
thau be the bestdreesed ol its lay figures.

That Orlston was elever no one, of course, denies—by far the
ablest inan of an age not strong in statesmanship. That he was
an ideal of saintly life no one would be so foolish as to essert.
But we may lairly claim that, judgsd by the standards of his
own day, he was, in point of character as well aa of ability, high
above most of his lellows, whether barone or bishops. Far nearer
to the truth than De la Moore's studied abuae is the judgmsut of
Henry de Blaneforde that Orleton was oir maturus st literali
scoralia excellenter oraretur, or of Robert of Readiug that he was
lionorilms ecclesiasticis per omuic dignus.
