1 Introduction.

Rymer's “ Foedera ’³ which shows beyond all doubt that the Govern-
ment was periectly sincere in its desire ior Gournay’s return to
England.

Very many oi De la Moore's statemeuts admit oi detailed
refutatiou in this way. But, aiter all, it is not his statemeuta
so much as his adjectivae which have affected the reputaticn oi
Orleton. The other contemporary historiens either, aa Murimouth,
give a ,bald and colourless record of events, or mention Orleton
with respect. The so-called monk ol Malmcsbury, “ the exactest,
the wisest, the most important, and in all respecta the best writer
oi his time,”¹ unhesitatingly refers the origin ol the trouble to
the King and his iavourites.²' Robert ol Reading, who, according
to Luard, must “rank as oi equal authority with the other
chroniclers ol the time,'’ classes Orleton with Thomas (lobham,
the most saintly man oi that avil day, and says that the Bisbop
oi Herclord was vir siquidem sciemiarum scripturis plenius imbutus,
et bonoribus ecclesiasticis par omnia diqnw He says, further, that
the King's violent proceedings against the Bishop oi Hereiord were
taken in contemptu Christi et Ecclesia atqua tedia Apostolus! We
have already scen, moreovcr, how Henry de Blanelord, iu nar-
rating Mortimer's escape, likens Orletou to the angel who reecucd

St. Peter from prison.

The simple truth oi the whole matter would seam to be
that a regicide-and De la Moorc’s master-stroke was to 'brand
Orlcton as Edwards murderer-is usually regarded aa the worst
oi rnen. Hence tha carelcss haste with which one writer alter

’ another has repeated the malignant slauders elaboretely fabricated
against Orleton by his rancorous and virulent traducor. Just ae
Oromwell’s character, ior two hundred years, was blackened by
persistent calurnny, until Carlyle stated, once for all, the simple
facts, so-si parva luet componire mipace-the iacta ol Orlaton's
hie bave only to be stated, to shew the utter baselessnese 0ch

la Moore's vile charges.
