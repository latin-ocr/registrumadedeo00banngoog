in all ways strove to rouee and sharpen ber indignation not only
against the Desponsers, but also against her husband.''¹ We dare
not praise, but we cannot greatly blame the Bishop for this course
oi action. He was no ideal saint, but a shrewd man-ol-the-world,
with a well-founded grievance against the King, and, as against
Despenser, the certain knowledge that ii he could not bring about
the downfall oi the iavourite, hia own absolute ruin was inevitable.
Moreover, Orletou was at least a statesman, ii he made no pre-
tensions to being a patriot. He saw clearly that the present
condition of things was impossible lor very much longer; that
Edward and his minion—or, perhaps, more correctly, his master-
had already brought the country to the vorge oi destruction. The
humiliating truce with the Scots, and the ever-growing arrogance
oi the French, proved the country's wealmess abroad; while, at
home, the general disorder was such that military summonses were
not obeyed‚ taxes could not be collected, and the whole country
was overrun by lawless men, many ol thamin Desponser’s pay,
and ministering to his greed. (lan we wonder that he who was,
perhaps, the strongest and ablest man theu in the land, deter-
minsd to cheok the madness ol the King while yet there was
time? That Orleton, outcast and beggared as hewse, lound the
task an easy one is, in itsell, his chieiest justification, since it
proves that the worthless King had alienated irom himself every
good and loyal mind in the realm.' Actually and literally,
Edward’s only friends were the Desponsers, Baldock, the chan·
oellor, and Stapledon, the treasurer-the Archbishop ol Yorlr and
the Bishop oi Rochester cannot be called iriends to the King,
though they ehrenk from acting against him. Meanwhile, between
France and England, matters were getting into a most critical
state. Philip V. had died early in 1322, and Oharles IV, who

succeeded, immediately summoned Edward to do homage lor

dquitaine. The Desponsers, who leared to be left in England
without the King, and ieared equally the journey to Franco, per·
suaded him not to go. The French King persisting in his
demand, and taking measures to invade the English possessione in
Gascony, relations rapidly grew worse between the two countries:

commerce was forbidden, merchants had their effecte seized in
both kingdoms, and even the Queen's French servants in England
