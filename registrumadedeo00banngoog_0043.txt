xxx Introduction.

Stratiord, the Pope expresses his surprise that the King and
. Desponser do not open their eyes and see that, for the acts done
against the Bishop of Herelord‚ God is offended. A long series
of Papal letters follows, through the years 1325-6, ιο the King
(to whom the Pope complains vthat he has written repeatedly
without effert), to the Papal nuncio in England, to the Queen, ιο
Hugh Despeneer, to the Arehhiehop of Oanterhnry, and to Orleton
himself. In this laet latter, dated June 7, 1325, the Pope eounsels
the Bishop to bebave with sueh humility ιο the King as may best
further his cause. The King writes, on May 28, 1325, urging the
Pope to remove Orleton “from our realm and jurisdiction, by
way of translation, both for the publio good, and for the particular
advantage of the Ohureh of Herelord‚ deprived ol its temporalities
abegere aaut culpa, aad raon eine cuma.'' He says that to retain the
Bishop in England is as dangereue as to earry fire in one's bosom,
or to nurse a serpent in one's lap, and urges tha Pope ιο take
aetion at onee ne ignia tam autumatur invehat, et in eorpus undique
se deffundat, et mnatre a capite flamine patamonis iniqua iterato
dissoluat. When the Pope, in reply deelared hie inability to do
this, Edward, on July 1, 1326, writes even more urgently, im·

ploring him to translate Orleton to some foreign bishoprie pre
tranquillitate ejusdem regni et quiete cordis nostri. This letter the
Pope seems simply ιο bave ignored, perhaps knowing that the
inevitable end was now very near for Edward.

During the two and a half years of virtual outlawry whieh
followed bis deprivation the Bishop lived almost entirely at Shin·
lield, making short visits, on oeeasion, to the dioeeee, or ιο London,
and heeping in constant communication with the Queen and with
Mortimer. One little incident from the Register is worth narrating.
In the summer of 1324 he started a new visitation of the diocese,
beginning, ee before, with the Forest Deanery.. Coming thenas
to the parish ehureh of Ross, he was celebrating mass, when
William de 1rhy, holder of the temporalities for the King, burst
into the ehureh, and before the congregation “ blasphemously reviled
the Bishop, though elad in hie pontifieal robes, ιο the grave
seandal of Christian people.'’ For this outrage the Bishop at enee
pronounoed against him the sentenee of major exeommunicatiom
lrby appealed to the Oourt of Canterbury, alleging that Orleton
had himself been exeommunicated, and that he had only obeyed
orders in denounoing him at Rosa. The ease was tried before
