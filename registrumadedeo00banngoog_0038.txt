. 16, the King summons the Bishops and Abbots to send con-
tingente 01 horse and 100110 meet him at Coventry, on the first
Sunday in Lautior service against Leucaster andHereford; and
it is carelully noted on the Roll that this requisition is not sent
to the Bishops 01 Hereford and Lincoln quibasdam de carnis.

‘l'o 101100· 10 detail the King’s campaign in the North would
be outside the scope 01 this introduction. It is sufficient to
remind the reader that, at Boroughbridge, on March 16, the Barons
were defeated. The Earl 01 Ηο101001 was slain 10 the fight;
100000100οἰ11 days later, was beheaded outside the walls 01 his
own castle at Pomfret; while Badiesmere, John Giffard, and
many others, were executed in various places. The Mortimers,
imprisoned in the Tower, were apparently overlooked lor the
immediate present. But, on June 13, a Commission is issued
for their trial, and, on July 14, they were senteuced to death. On
July 22, through the strenuoua efforts 01 Orleton, supported by the
Bishop 01 Durham, who had great influence with the King‚ the
sentence was commuted to perpetual imprisonmeut. Edward had
already, 00 Feb. 11, 1011 himself strong enough 10 recall the
Despensers ; and now, for four dreary years, the hated favourites
were virtually rulers 01 England. Even De la Moore, friend to
Edward though he is, writes of these years “ Videbantur pro nno
tras jam aare Anplia rapea.”¹

On March 16, 1322 (the day on which the battle at Borough-
bridge was being fought), the Bisbop removed from his office Philip,
the Prior 01 Ohirbury. Athis visitation 01 the Priory he had
lound much that needed correction, owing to the weakness rather
than the wickedness ,01 the Prior. The Bishop, therefore, alter
making, lor the right conduct 01 the house, etrict regulations,
which the Prior promised to observe, had permitted him to retain
his office. Finding, however, that the new regulations were not
being carried out, he now compelled Brother Philip to resign,
and acoeded 10 110 unanimous wish 01 the Oenone that Hugh
de Hereford, 000 01 themselves, should be Prior.

At the great Parliament 01 York (May 2-19), so vitally im-
portant in the constitutions} history 01 Englaud, Orletou was
present, though he probably took little part iu the debates, which
