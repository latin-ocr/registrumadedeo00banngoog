xlviii Introduction.

more harshly treated by historiens-more especially in the matter
ol adjectivae. ‘⁴ Vindictive prelate,” ‘⁴ pestilent Achitophel,'' ‘⁴ in·
iamous consipirator,” “iactious schemer,” “bitter and unscrupulous
traitcr”—these and the like phrases have been handed on from
writer tc writer,¹ since first De la Moore composed his Vita ct

ὁ crore Edwarda' eccardi, in which, on every pege, Orleton plays the

partui Iago; though, in Dela Moore's romanoe, it is Desdemona
who is begniled into murdering Othellc. This work ol Dela Moore
is a perfect exemplification ol the old proverb that, ii only a man
throws mud enough, some will be sure to stick. Ol all the con-
temporary writers, Dela Moore alone peints Orleton's character
in hlack. Now De la Moore is, es Stubbs confesses, the least
valuable of these contemporary authorities; but he is, oi them
all, by fer the most vivid and picturesque. Hence every succeed-
ing writer has taken his adjectives from de la Moore’s graphio
story.

A knight ol Gloucestershird-or, as Stubbs thinks, ο1 Oxlord·
shira-De la Moore had passed his youth ae a equire in Stratiord's
household. In attendance upon Stratiord, he had gone with the
envoys oi the Perliament tc Kenilworth, to receive the King's
resignation ; and he seems to have been afriend and admirer oi
the Archbishop through lile. He wrote the Vita ct mors in or
about 1347, ia. five or six years aiter Orleton had written-as
was alleged-the sanwsua libellas, in which the good knight's friend
and patron was so bitterly attached. It is clear, irem the accounts,
that party feeling in the matter ran very high: violent abuss-
even cursing-wss indulged in by both sides. It will easily be
seen, then, why De la Moere, writing at a time when his iriend-
ior Stratiord received no seculer office aiter the quarrel ο1 1341-
was spending what proved to be the last year ol his lile in oom-
pulsory retirement lrom ministerial work, hates Orleton es the
cause ο1 all this. We can quite readily understand how he comes
to maire Orleton the villain oi the pisce. As a matter ol lact
the Vita ct ocare scarcely even pretends to be a serious historical

l-There ia one brilliant exception to this cherusci parret-lille condemnation. The
learned German historiari ο1 Enniand. Dr. Pauli. aare that Orleton was “ein llann von

wissen und Character.''

2-·Thc argument which follows is not in any way affected. should Sir Ε. tlaunde
Thompson prove to be correct in holding that the νῆα et mors is not the work ο1 De la
idoare. but ie the early part ο1 the chronicle ο1 Geolirey le Balcer. For the knight was
Baker's patron. and the chronicle is written irem Dela Moere's coint ο1 view. even il not
