ii Introduction.

it? The presumptive evidence, however, of the name itself is not
of much velue. A hundred years earlier it would have been most
unlikely that a man born in an important town should tske his
name from a comparatively insignificant hamlet. But sumames¹
in the modern sense of the word, were certainly coming into com-
mon use towards the end of the 13th century. And there would
seem to be some evidence that a family, taking its name from
the Mortimer Msnor of Orleton, was already settled in Hereford
in the, middle oi the 13th century. It is, however, not until the
early years of the 14th century that the name begins commonly
to occur in the records of Hereford. For friends and relatives
began then to receive a helping hand from their successful liius
man, and we soon find Richard, Reginald, Thomas, Henry, John,
and William de Orleton holding leading positione in the town?

These consideratious stated, we must leave open the question
whether Adam de Orleton was born at Orleton, or in Hereford
itseli-whether Leland’s statement is literally correct, or whether,
perhaps, it is to² be taken in a general sense, as implying that
Adam de Orleton was Bishop in his native county or diocese. It
is highly probable, in any cese, from his close connection with the
Mortimere, and his life-long devotion to their house, that one cf
the Mortimer family was the boy’s patron in early years. If born
in Hereford, the young Adam would have obtained the rudimeuts of
learning in the school attached to the Gathedral Thence, with
some assistance from his patron, he would pass to Oxford, and,
later on, to Paris or Orleans. We may hope that the help cf
Mortimer, and his own shrewdness and ability, saved the young
scholar from the necessity of joining those bands of needy studente
who used to go in procession through the streete of Paris, crying

But all this, though highly pmbeble, is based on mere oon-
jecture. What we know for certain is that, in the year 1307,
Orleton is officially styled utrimque juria perium-well versed in
