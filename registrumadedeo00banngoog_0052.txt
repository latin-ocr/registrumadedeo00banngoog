The Deposany os tte Κίοιο. xxxix

third day the Archbishcp of (lanterbury followed, with an oration
on the theme Vox populi, voa mi,- and at the close made the
formal announcement that “by the common consent ci all the
Earls and Barons, the Archbiehops, Bishops, and all the clergy
and people, King Edward was deposed ircm his former dignity,
and that the Lord Edward, his eldest son, should succeed his
iether on the throne.”

The neat business was ιο secure the King’s consent. For this
purpose a deputaticn was appointed to proceed to Kenilworth and
treet with the King. This deputation consisted of the Bishops
of Herelord‚ Winchester‚ and Lincoln, with two Earls, tour Barons,
two Abbots‚ and certain representatative knights, twenty-four per·
sons in all. The party reached Kenilwcrth on Jan. 20, and
Stratiord and Burghersh went in to the King at once, ιο prepare
him ior the proposal they had ιο make. Everyone kncws Dela
Moore's dramatic account ci the interview,¹ with its pathetic
touches, artfully introduced to excite pity ior the hapless King,
and indignation against Orleton-how the triumphant plotter mar-
shalled his deputetion in the King's cantero, reserving to himself
the office ol spokesman—how the King, coming from the inuer
chamber, clad in a plain black robe, iell back fainting at the sight
cl his relentless foe-how Orleton, mire imprimat, beginning his
address while the King, still half-unconscious‚ was supported in
the arms of Henry ol Lancaster and the Bishop ol Winchester,
bluntly put it ιο the wretched monarch that his choico lay be·
tween abdicating in favour oi his son, and being dethroned ιο
make room lor a strenger-how the unhappy Edward, cum fletu et
ejulatu, replied that he was sorry tc have given such offence to
his people, but was well pleased thht they should have chosen his
son ior king—how the homage was renounced‚ and the staff oi
the steward oi the royal household broken-how, returning to
London, Orleton announced in Parliament the answer oi the King
pictae, immo pleribus qrtom factum suit. six articles were drawn
up-—quoted in full hy Orleton himself in his “Defence,''² where he

says they were draited by Stratiord—giving the reasons for the
change of eovereignty. The coronation ol the young King, on Jan.
29, completed the revolution.
