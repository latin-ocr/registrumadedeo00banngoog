portione of whioh, nt Avignon, he hed seoured spsoinl euthorizetion
from the Pope. During the visitetion ol the diooese in 1318 the
Deen und Chapter of the Onthedrnl hod claimed exemption, plesd·
ing e compromise mede in “the time of the lete Bishops.” Such
n disputo between u Bishop end the Denn and Chapter of his
Gathedrol wne no >new thing. Few indeed were the dioceses in
which the Bishop wes not looked upon ss en intr-udor in his own
Gathedrel. 'Phe quarrels even of the seintly Edmund Rioh with
his monastic Chapter ere well known; end still more notorious hod
been the long disputo between Grosseteste aud tho Ghepter of .
Lineoln, which lueted six years. Orleton, egreeing with Grosseteste
thet it would be well if e Bishop visited his Oethedrel every dey,¹
had obtained from the Pope eleoulty to “visit end eorreot'' the
Desu und Ohepter “notwithstanding uny oustom to the eontrnry.’'
St. Guthlno's hed nlso resisted visitation3 end St. Guthluo's needed

in order the Priory ol Abergevenny. John de Hostings, Lord of
Aberguvenny, whose nnoestors hed founded the Priory, hed petitioned
the Pope to enqnire into the stete ol the house. On Sept. 27,
therefore, the Bishop‚ by the Pope's order, held un inquiry. He

sum on whioh 13 monks or more could easily be supported.
Further, John de Hastings granted them 220 e year, with two

und some five or six monks were living a life “enormously dissolute.’'
The Prior was openly guilty of edultery und fomioetion, while the
monks were constently seen hy the luity going about with loose
women, gaming when they should heve been engaged in divine
servioe, end even carrying out u blesphemous perody of the ornei-

lixion. On being cited to eppeer et the inquiry, Fullr hed stolen
