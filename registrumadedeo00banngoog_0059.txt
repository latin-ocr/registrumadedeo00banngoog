' to set forth her answer 10 these complaints, whieh I did, adding

nothing of my own, nor lessening 01 011 what 1100 commanded
me. Later on, when Iwas abroad, the Queen called a Gonnoil at
8101010111, where the whole question was earefully debated, and it was
decided that they oould not allow her to joiu her husband, which
she was'quite ready to 110. Μο100101, long before, even in Franee,
the Queen had well-grounded 1001001 her husband’s oruelty, 00 is
proved by the following letter 10 W. Arohbishop 01 Canterbury,
who 111111 written requesting her to retnrn.'' [Thon follows the
Queen's letter, dated ⁴‘ Paris, the Sunday after the Purifieation,’'
statiug that she was in fear of bodily harm 10 herself from Hugh
Despenser‚ and, in consequence, she does not dare 10 return] The
deposition of the King, Orleton further states, was lawfully brought
about by agreement drawn up by J [ohn Stratiord], then Bishop
01 Winohester, now Arohbishop·eleet 01 Cauterbury. [Here he
quotes the agreement in full] “ As 10 what they 0011 the capture
of the King, the King went of his own free will to the oastle of
his kinsman, the 11011 of Lanoaster, and there he was in health
and safety when 1 left Euglend, 0111110 business of the present
King, 101 the 001111 01 Rome.''

For nine 1110111110 1110 King withheld from Orleton the tempor·

only did the Bishop 001110 out of his comparative retirement—to
take part in the attack upon stratford in 1341. The King, on
Nov. 30,1340‚ had unexpeotedly returned from the Frenoh 1101,
angry and mortified 01 1110 110111 01 success, and 01 the failure of
