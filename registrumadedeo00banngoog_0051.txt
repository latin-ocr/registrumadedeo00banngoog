xxxviii Introduction.

When the Parliament assembled on Jan. 7, 1327, the proceed-
ings were entirely directed by the Bishop of Hereiord. He began
by proposing that the King should be asked to attend, cd faciendae
et ordinandum pro corona Anptie cam accis ligiis minibus qnod
deceret et qnod justicio suaderet. Orleton himself and stratford
were at once despatched to Kenilworth to make this propoeal to
the King.¹ Edward received them with contemptuous revilings,
and refused to come amongst traitors. Returning, therefore, they
announced, on Jan. 12, in the great hall of westminster, before
the clergy and people, that the King refused to come to the Par-
liament. Next day, the proceedinge were somewhat tumultuous.
The Bareas and representative members came together curo empne
strepitu, and a great crowd of London citizens (the men who
had murdered Bishop Stapledon three months before) also pushed
their¹ way into the hall. There the Bishop of Hereiord delivered
a speech or sermon, taking for his text Ber incipiens perdet
poputum acerna.² He went into great detail concerning the fellica
and imbecilities of the King, his childish actions-“if indeed they
ought to be called childish”—and all the many evils which had
beiallen the land under his ruis. He declared further, that if the
Quaen returned to the King, she would be murdered by him.
Orleton was admittedly an eloquent speaker, and on this occasion
he hade case which spoke for itself. He seems so skilfully to
have worked upon the feelings of his hearers that spontaneously,
as with one voice, they burst out, “We will not have this man
to rule over us.'’³ Thereupon he bade them go home, and, return·
ing next day at the third honr, give a definite reply to the question
he would then put to them, whom they would prefer as king, the
father or the son.

On the following day Stratiord preached on the text Capiet
ewam doleo, and showed how weak a head England had had these
many years. After this, Orleton put his question, which they

would prefer, the father or the son, for king. And “with one
voice the son is chosen, and led into the great hall to the cry,
Ecce rec cester: to which the crowd replied Ave rec.”⁴ On the
