Ledbury, they oeme 1ο Bosbury, “where Adam, Bishop ol Here-
ford, then was, and there eseoret eonferenoe was held between
the Bishop and Roger Mortimer ”; efter which Mortimer went with
his ermy to Ledbury, end ‘⁴ carried off lood and other property
to the velue of ,2100 or more.” Next day the Bishop “sent Roger
reinloreements lor his ormy,” the nemes of the leaders being given.¹
Then ell, in one company, went towards Glouoester, perpetrating
divers wrong-doings on the way.

Α thtever be the extent to whieh the Bishop hed supported
Mortimer‚ he seems, ior the moment et eny rete, to have, in some
sort, mode his peaes with the King.¹ For, on Feb. 6, the very
day of his arrival in Glouoester, Edwerd signs a mandate to
Thomas de Hastings to restore to the Bishop “ the oestle oelled
Bisshopes-eestel whioh the King lately took into his hends.’' And,
two deye later, he issues to the Bishop Letters ol Proteotion for
one yeer. Morsover, on Feb. 2, and again on Feb. 25, the King
writes to the Pope bitterly complaining ol Burghersh, qui dieto .
Bortolomeo, nostro rebelli, toris viribus adheret, end of John de
Drokenslord, both of whom, he says, heve openly joined the rebel
Lords. He even deprived Burghersh ol his temporalities,⁸ and
on April 13 writes to the Pope, esking him eontra dictos epis·
oopoe (ie. Linooln end Beth end Wells only) procedere rigorose.⁴
Itis olesr, therefore, thet es yet the King does not think very
seriously of Orleton’s perticipation in the rising, as compared
with the doings oi Burghersh end Drokensiord. As we shall
see, Edwerd hes other reasons, two years later, for reviving the
charge. We may note, however, thet from Glouoester, on Feb.
