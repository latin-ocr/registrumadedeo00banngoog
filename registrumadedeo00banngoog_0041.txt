xxviii Introduction.

Ii the Bishop hed enernies st Conrt, he hed, in his diocese,
meny friends, bold end resolute. Honos the “seizing into the
King's hends’' ol the Bishop's temporale beeeme no light mutter.
‘Phe work wne entrusted io John de Hempton, eecheetor ior the
Merohes ol Weles, und to Orleton’s bitter enemy, Williem de Irby,
the Prior ol St. Guthleo's ; end letters ol protection ere issued to
them on Meroh 20.¹ But the Bishop’s friends were belorehend
with them. John end Thomas de Orleton‚ elerios though they
were, organised bends ol willing helpers, who systematieelly visited
the Bishop’s menois, end drove off the horses, oren, oows, sheep,
end other enimels. Ar Ross, the Prior ol St. Guthleo’s neme upon
themidem, end wne very roughly hendled by thern, in spite ol
his letters ol protention, nerrowly eseeping with his lile. For this

· essnult, snd'elso lor the driving ewey ol the stonk, sleven ol the

ringleeders were put upon their triel.¹ It wes not until the
autumn, however, thet the Prior seoursd possession oi the various
menore end whnt wes left ol the stoelr.⁸ At length, on Oet. 12,
1324, John Inge ie appointed to survey the lunds ol the Bishoprie,
end to spprsise the eorn, stoek, und other goods therein. But
the Bishop’s friends would still seem to heve been notive; lor, on
Feb. 13 ol the next year, John Inge is found anxiously enquiring
efter the unknown persons who hed onoe egeln entered the Menor
ol Bishop's Oestle end driven off forty brood meres with their
iseue.⁴

The violenoe ol ihe King end Desponser—lor the younger
Hugh heted end ieered Orleton more passionetely then did the
King, ii thet were possible—did not eveil to divert the Bishop
from hie settled purpose ol resouing the Mortimers from the
Tower. They hed been more then two ysers in prison, being
