Bishop’s favour. Thereupon he once again excommunicated Irby.
'I'he unfortunate Prior was driven at length humbly ιο sue ior
absolution, which-somewhat reluctantly it would seem—the Bisbop
was compelled to give.

It is scarcely ιο be wondered at that, during these years, the
Register‚ which at first had been carefully kept, seems ιο have
been written up hastssy, and at odd times. One oi the most
curicus features oi the Orleton Register-due probably to this
absence irom the diocese-is that we have many references ιο
ordinatione, but no list oi those ordained. This is the more notice-⁴
able since, during the six years oi his episcopato at Worcester,
Orleton ordained over a thousand persons. At one ordination at
Tewkssbury he ordained 406, at one at Campdsn 419 persons.

his influsnce with the King on his behall. Henry oi Lancaster
was a man iar' more attractive in character than his brother
Thomas had been. Oourteous, kind-hearted, and high-principled,
he replies to the outcast Bishop in a letter iull oi encourage-
