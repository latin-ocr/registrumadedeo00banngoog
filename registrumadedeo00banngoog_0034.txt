The Disputc about Gower. xxi

war. The final outbreak was brought about by the disputa con-
cerning Gower. 'l'he three heiressee of the great Gloucester

Earldom had married Hugh Despenser the younger, Hugh D'Audeley
the younger, and Roger D’Amory, each of these receiving, in Nov,
1317, a third of the inheritance. From the first Despenser
coveted-and apparently got possession of-D'Audeley’s lande round
Newport, which lay to the east of the Despenser lande in Glamor-
gan. Not content with this, the foolish favourite attempted to
extend his lande to the svestward also. William de Braose, the·
spendthrift Lord oi Gower, had, for two years before his death in
1320, negociated for its eale with his eon-in·law, John Mowbray‚
with the Elarl of Hereford, and with the Mortimers. But Despenser,
sager to obtain Gower ior himself, thwarted all arrangements for
the sale, and finally claimed that Gower should be seized into the
King's hands, on the ground that Braose had no right to alienate
his lande without the King's consent. This claim of Despenser’s
was a direct infringement of the “ custom of the March,” imply-
ing, as it did, that the Marcher Lords held their land under the
sams conditione as lande in England. The Marcher [orde at once
rose indolence of their rights, and, in spite of the King’s pro·
hihition, which Edward was too weak to make effective, Hereford
and the Mortimers began together a force to raid the Despenser ·
lande. In March, 1321, the King came west 1ο Gloucester,
and summoned the Marcher Lords to a council there on April 5,
which summons they simply dieregarded. His fecble attempt to
make peace having failed, Edward returned to London. There-
upon the Bohun and his confederates began, on May 4, the
systematic ravaging of the Despenser lande, capturing Newport,¹
Gardiff, and other castles held by the younger Hugh. Edward,
meanwhile, called a Parliament for July 15 (Orleton’s writ of eum-
mons is dated May 15). But Lancaster‚ as if in open defiance,
himself also summoned, at Sherburn, near Pontefract, on· June 28,
what may be called a Parliament, which pledged itsclf 1ο maintain
the querrel against the Despensers. The Earl of Hereford and the
Mortimere attended this meeting: I have not been able to dis-f
cover whether Orleton 1111111111111111111111111111.1 But, very shortly
afterwards, the discontented Barons re-assembled at St. Albane,
where Orleton certainly took part in the proceedings‚ and, with

four other Bishops, was sent as a deputation to the King, peremp
