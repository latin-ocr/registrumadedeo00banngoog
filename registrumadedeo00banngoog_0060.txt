Orleton's death. xlvii

Here the matter might hsve ended; bnt Stratiord's enemies at
Oourt did not mean it to end hers ; and Stratiord-who was by
no means brilliant or elever, but had risen to his high position
because he was an eminently “ saie '⁹ man ior official purposes-
lorgetting bis usual cantion, played into their hands by delivering
a course ol sermons, in which he compared himself to St. Thomas
of Oanterhrry, and reminded the King of the late oi his father.
This provoked Edwerd, on Feb. 10, 1341, to issue a sort ot
pemphlet, called s libellus saetosus, inll of violent abusa of the
Archhishop‚ who is mede snswerebls ior all the ill-success of the
recent expedition. Stratiord and his supporters alleged that this
pamphlet had been written by Orleton.¹ It is more than likely
that Orleton-already quito blind¹-gladly welcomed the invitation
to come out ol his retirement in order to lesd the attach upon
the man who, more then any other, save perhaps William de
Montacuto, was responsible for the death of his dearest friend. He
msy even, with the seme skill as oi old, have suggested the
general line of argument to the writer, whoever he wss. But we
have his own definite denial that he wrote the libellus scaurus as
it stands.³ The unseemly interview in the Psinted Chamber, on
April 27, when Orleton and Bourchier, the angry spokesmen oi
the engry King, tried to force submission on the Archbishop,
as hs peraded his ieebly theatrical imitation oi the very words
and gestures of the martyred Becket, reflecte little credit on any-
one concerned, and is best passed over in silence. When a recon-
ciliation was patched up, on Moy 7, Orleton went back to his

diocese, snd lived in the quiet discharge of his routine duties
until his death, at Farnhem, July 18, 1345!

What is the verdict on this lile that we heve thus briefly
sketched? Probably no one, not even Tiberius or Nero, has been
