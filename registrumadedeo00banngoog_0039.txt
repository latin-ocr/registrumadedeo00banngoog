were directed mainly by the Despensars. They, all unwittingly .

and unintentionally (for their only object was 10 1100 Edward from
the restrain of the Ordinances), made a great constitutional
advance, laying down the principle of the three estates of the realm.

Whilst the Bishop was away in York, a band 01 010101001010,
headed by John, Richard, and Thomas Irby-presumably relatives
01 the Prior of St. Guthlac's, who cherished a bitter hatred against
Orleton-made a raid upon the episcopal mauors 01 Ross and
Upton, driving away two horsea, 120 0100, 240 sheep, and many
other animale, carrying off quantities of wheat, oats, and other
produce, and, for 15 days, charcoal-burning in tha Bishop's woods,
the total damage being assessed at over 2240. The Bishop, on
his return, had sentence 01 excommunication pronounced against
the malefactore, and they were summoned before the Justices, at
York, in July‚ with what result I have not been able to discover.

For the next sixteen months the Bishop was at one or other
01 his mauors, and for the last three months 01 1323 01 Shinfisld,
engaged in dioceses work, and at the same time planning the
escape oi the Mortimers from the Tower. The King had well·
founded suspicions that Orleton was intriguing 101 their release,
and perhaps already suspected him of amusing the hatred of the
Quaen against the Desponsers, which De la Moore asserta that
Orleton deliberately set himself to do. Edward could, however, find
00 occasion against him, though in private he often denounced and
lampooned the Bishop.¹ Seeing no other means 01 attaok—for the
Bishop was a far cleverer man than the King-Edward was driven
10 revive the charge, which he had virtually condonsd in the pre·
vicus year, 01 aiding Mortimer in rebellion. In accordance with
a royal brief (dated Skipton, Oct. 1, 1323) 00 Inquisition was held
at Hercford 00 Jan. 23, 1324, before “Sir Henry Staunton and
his compaciona'’' Justices 01 the King. Orleton did 001 appear,
and they found him guilty in his absence. The Purliament was
summoned at Westminster for March l, and there Edward, before
the magnates 01 the kingdom, placed Orleton on his trial for high
trcason. It would almost seem, from Blaneforde’s account,⁸ that

the King personally brought forward the charge, in a bitter and
