Tite molire os De la Moore. xlix

work. Itis a political pampblet, a counterblast to the sarmata
tihellus.1 But, while no oue professes to accept as fact the violent
exaggeratione ol the libellus, the bitter and venomous phrases
ol De la Moore against Orleton, artiully set off by pathetic—
and equally untrustwortby-stories oi the insulta and tortures in·
flicted on the martyr King, have baeu accepted without examination,
and have been banded on lrom writer to writer, from that day to
this. Omnis hujus mali architector, Sacerdos Boot, Atramitae
Jesabeltc (note tbe play on the Quaen’s name), proditor focaudus,
disceptator sophisticus-one cannot loolt through De la Moore's
pemphlet (scarcely twenty peges in all) without coming upon these
and the like phrases again and yet again. And ol no one else,
save occasionally ot Burghersh‚ does he ever speak with bitter-
ness. Even he is compelled to admit that Orleton was vir inperito
callidissimus, ct prttdeatia mitadana summas' But he persistently
represents him as the sole cause ol the troubles which belel the
all-but·saintly King. It would not be difficult—tbough space does
not allow it here-to go through De la Moore’s narrative, point
by point, and show how maliciously he has twisted every detail,
attributed evil motives to the most innocent actions, and dragged
Orleton's name into proceedings with which be has no connection
whatever. Some oi these spiteiul inventione have been incident·
atly related iu the preceding peges. But one typical example
may useiully be examined bere. In the last few lines ol his worlr,⁸
telliug ol the death oi Sir Thomas Gouruay, oue oi the murderers
ol the King, De la Moore asserta that the fugitive was captured
at Marseilles, and, while being brought back to England by sea,
was put to death on shipboard ric sorte magistros et magnos proluar

. . occaecasset. It happens that, in the arth volume oi
‘'Archaeologia,” are printed the official letters and exchequer claime
dealing with the death oi Gournay. These documenta prove that
Gournay was arrested at Naples; that he was brought by eea to
Coloure, in Roussillon, and, very siclt, travelled by land to Bayonue,
where-though his guarda paid twenty florius to two physioians,
and spent thirty-two florina on medicine-he died, and his body
was brought to Englaud. Moreover, there is a letter printed in
