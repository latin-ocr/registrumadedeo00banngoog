xviii Introduction, .

Robert Bruce to appear before him at Avignon, before May l,
and aske lora saie-conduct for him that there may be no delay.
This lettsr¹ Orleton forwarded, together with one from himself, to
Archbishop Melton, who sent on both to the Bishop of Norwich;
and he, in turn, laid them before the Gonnoil. Tha Gouncil, ou ·
Apn'l 18, decided that as the scheme had proceeded from the Pope,
not from ¹the King, the certificate oi safe conduct ought to be
made out to the Bishop of Hereford‚ as the Pope’s agent in tha
business ; and a form oi saie-conduct is enclosed, in which itis
made clear that the matter is not done volente domino rastro repe,
uel ejas concilio corruente. The Archbishop—one of the few entirely
upright men of that day—replies, on April 24, that in Orleton's
letter fit auctio quod ca deliberatione corwilir' fieret caecatio dicturam
literarum: he declines, therefore, to accept the form proposed by
the Council. We may suppose the real point at issue to have been
the implied claim of the Pope to the over-lordship of England,
which the Holy See had never ceased to essert, since the grant
by King John on ‘the eve oi Ascension-day, 1213. Whether Orleton
had acted in ths matter for the King or the Pope remained per·
force uncertain, since he was not at hand to offer any explanation.
For Badlesmere, meanwhile, had determined to go to the Pope him·
self, with Orleton, on his naphew's behalf; and, at the same time,
the King could no longer defer his risit to Franco to perform the
homage. So, on March 10, Orleton and Edmund, the King's brother,
with Badiesmere and Hugh Desponser tha elder, leave Dover with
letters of credence, both to the Frencb Oourt, where they are to
arrange ior the interview between the two Kings, and also to the
Pope, with whom they are to press for the promotion of Burghersh.
They are in Paris on April 1, and soon afterwards in Avignon,
where, on May 27, they secure the issue of a Bull, setting asido
the election ol the Chapter, and ⁴appointing Burghersh to the See
of Lincoln. The matter of the canonization, meanwhile, was not
neglected;¹ and on April 17 the name of Cantilupe was inscribed in
the catalogue of Saints.² On June 19 the King crossed to Franco,

and did homage at Amiens. On the return journey, at Boulogne,
on Sunday, July 20, Burghersh was consecrated, in the King's
presence, by John Salmon, Bishop of Norwich, Walter Stapledon,
oi Exoter, and Orleton.
