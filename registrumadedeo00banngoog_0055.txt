a member also of the Gouucil of Twelve, which guided the action
of the young King. And, as Treasurer, he was occupied in the
congenial work of administration. The new government, from
the first, showed signs oi disruption, since the young King and
his friends-of whom stratford aud Montacute were the chief-
were already proviug restive under Mortimer'e authority, und re·
sented the rule of the “ Queeu's Bishops.’'¹ Orleton’s shrewdness
and ability would, therefore, have been most helpful at home.
But the Queen and Mortimer probably realised how important
it was that a trustworthy representative should go at once to
the Papal Oourt, and justify the revolution to the Pope¹ And
so, ou March 30, accompanied by Bartholomew de Burghersh,
knight, and Thomas de Asteley, clerk, Orleton started for Avignon,⁸
the Bishop of Lincoln succeeding him at the Treasury. The
envoys went first to Valsuoienues (and possibly to the French
Oourt also), reaching Arignon only ou tuly 14. The Pope was
eagerly expecting Orleton, anxious to have a trustworthy account
of the state of affairs in England.‘ On the day after the Bishop's
arrival, John XXII sent Bartholomew de Burghersh back with a

letter professing inability to grant the dispensation for the King's
marriage.⁶ On the sams day there is au entry in the Papal
Registsr that the Pope granted to Adam, Bishop of Hereford, an
indult that his confessor may give him, being peniteat, plenary
forgiveness of his sins at the hour of death; aud granted him
also faculties to fill up three vacant canonries of Hereford.

The Bishop remained at Aviguon all the summer, obtaining

wished-for dispensation for the King’s marriage. Iu England,
meanwhile, Thomas Oobham, Bishop of Woroester, died on Aug.
