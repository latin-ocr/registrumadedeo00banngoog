torily demanding the exile of the Despensers. When the King
refused, the Barons appeared in arms before the gates of London;
but, prefatis episeopis laudabiliter mediantilnar,l the King at length
yields, and alfows proeeedings to be taken against his favourites,
in the Parliament of July 15. They were, ol course, condemned to
forfeiture and exile.

'Phe war, however, oould not now he averted. Bodlesmere,
‚who had been driven into opposition by Edwards persistent favour
to the Desponsata, began at onee to fortify hie oastles; and his
wife, at Leeds Oastle, on Oet. 13, refused hospitality to the Queen.
Edward, thoroughly roused by this insuit, issued, three days later,
write of summoue to his berone, and, on the rard, was before
Leeds Oastle with a strong foroe, including Pembroke and five
other Earls; the eastle surrendered on the 3lst. Finding himself
at the head of a fer stronger force than he had hoped to get
together, Edward now determiued to orush the Marcher Iaords.
First, however, he wished to get the proceedings against the
Despeusers deelared illegal. For this purpose, Arohbishop Reynolds
called a Oonvooation of the Seuthem Provinoe for Dee. 10. Bishop
Orleton writes from Boshury, on Nor. 29, that justis et urgentibus

’ maritalibus multipliciter impeditae, he sends Adam de Murimouth,
Canon of Hereford, aud Roger de Breinton, Rector of Aka, to
offer his excuses. Murimouth,¹ deseribing the meetiug, says Pauci
venrant propter horrorem et uiarum discrimina et temporis brevi-
tatem. Scantily attended though it was, the Convocation pronouneed
that the proceedings against the Desponsers had been illegal.

The King passed the Ghristmas at Oireneester, intending,
with the new year, to move to Glouoester; but Mortimer antici·
peted him, ooeupying the town, and holding it in forne. Edward,
therefore, edvanned to worcester-,⁸ hoping thore to oross the Severo
and reid the Mortimer and Bohun lands in the March.⁴ Finding
that the Barons held the opposite bank of the Severn with a
strong forne, he went on to Bridgnorth, where the Mortimens
attached a royel soouting party, and burned the town.⁶ At
