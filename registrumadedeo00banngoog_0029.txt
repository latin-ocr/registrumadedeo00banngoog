at Leek, on Aug. 9.² He was appointed one of the standing
committes of twelve, dc discretioribus totius repsi,² six ol whom
were to be always in attendance on the King. Scarcely was this

arrangement completed when Orletou receives instructions te return ·
to the French Oourt, not on the business oi the homage (which is ,

postponed until after the meeting ol Parliament in November), but
