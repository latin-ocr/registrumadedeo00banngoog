Meanwhile, at home in England, Richard Swinfield, Bishop of
Hereford, had died, on March 15, 1317. The King at once wrote
to the Pope, ashing him to appoint Thomas de Oharletcn to the
vacant See. But the Pope, wishing tc have a strong and capable

man, personally devoted to himself, among the English Bishops,
gave Orleton the preferment, the deed of appointment being signed
cn May 15. Concurrent lettere were sent, on the same day, to the
Chapter of Hereford, to the clergy and peopls of the Dioneae, to
the vessels of the Bishopric, to the Archbishop of (lanterbury, and
to the King. Fearing that this might happen—for Edward had
already heard that Orleton was high in favour with the new Pope—
the King writes, on May cah, a more urgent letter, strongly prese· ‚
ing the claime of Charleton, and warning the Pope that if, qood
obsit, he promoted Orleton tc the Bishopric, illud, quibmdom dc
cararia piros ad presens subticeam, rrobr‘r grace uideretur, acc illud
personas pro honore nostro qucrrrcdolibct tolerare? This letter he
sent to Arignon by the hand cf John de Hildesle. On May 9 he
writes also to the Dean and Chapter of Hereford, asking them to
proceed at once to the electiori of the new Bishop, with private
letters tc the Oenone individually, urging them to procura Oharleton’s

· electiori. It would seem, however, that the Chapter, already aware
of the new Pope's policy of reservation, did not proceed to an
electiori.

As well as the letter tc the Pope, John de Hildesle carried
with him to Arignon a letter from the King to Orletcn himself,
forbidding him to accept the Bishopric. In this letter the King
says: Ob aliquae certor coccos, quac ad praseae ardricemcr dc
cobis prccotr'm r'ato tempore collaterana confidimus : and further, cf
Orletcn’a promotion to the Bishopric, ri ito ficret, jari corone
rroatrc rcgr'c derogaretur. Finally he commanda him, if by chance
promotion to the said Bishopric should be offered him, not to
give his consent “as he values his own peace and advancement,
and that oi his friende.”⁸
