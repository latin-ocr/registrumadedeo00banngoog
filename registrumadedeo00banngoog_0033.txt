and had flod away by night. With the consent, therefore, of tbo
Bishop of Llandaff, in whose diocese the Priory was, Orletou .
deposed the Prior and appointed in his place Richard de Bromwich,
a learned and saintly monk of Worcester. The Abbot of St.
vincente, Lo Mans, to which monastery the Priory of Aberga-
venny was subject, protestsd to the Pope that the Bishop of
Hereford and John de Hastings had removed the Prior without
consulting the parent House. John XXII, therefore (under date
lKal. Ap, 1321), summoned all the parties interested to appear
before him by their Proctors. How the matter ended Ι have not
been able to discover.

Hurrying to London for the meeting of Parliament on Oct. 6,
Orleton is appointed one of the Auditors of Petitions for Gascony,
Ireland‚ and the Norman Isles. In November he pays a short
visit to Shinfield to arrange for the appropriation of the tithes of
that benefice to the fabric fund of the Gathedral-a settlement
which has persisted to the present day. Throughout the December
of this year, and January, 1321, the Bishop was busy with the
routine work of the diocese ; and about the middle of February be
is sent 'abroad once more pro quibasdam arduis negotiis, reaching
England again before May 15. Thenceforward to the end of the
year he devoted himself alternately to the work of tho diocese and
to the struggle against the Despsnsers. On Oct. 5, he was able to
fulfil his promise of reforming the condition of St. Guthlac’s. The
Prior, William Irby, who had been cellarer of the parent House at
Gloucester‚ had only been in office since some date later than
Sept, 1316, when he was still at Gloucester. But already, by his
dissolute life, he had brought the Priory into evil repute, while his
mismanagement of the temporalities had caused serious financial
embarrassment.¹ The Bishop, with his usual vigour and decision,

removed the offender, and appointed in his place Thomas de
Burghill.²
