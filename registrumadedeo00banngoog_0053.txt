Introduction.

The Parliament continued in session until March 9, settling
the details 01 the administration. The young King being only
iourteen years old, a standing oouncil 01 advice was appointed,
consisting 01 the two Archbishops, and the Bishops 01 Hereiord
and winchester, together with Henry 01 Lancaster, and seven
others. The Bishop 01 Ely was appointed Obancellor, and Orleton,
ior the immediate present, became Treasurer.¹ He only held the
office, however, lor two months, and 01 his official acts as Treasurer
Ican only find two notices. On March 6, ‘¹ Adam, Bishop 01
Herelord, our Treasurer,” with the Archbishop ol Canterbury,
Mortimer, Lanoaster, and others, witnesses the King’s reuewal 01
the charior oi liberties to the city ol London.’ And an entry
in the Oripirtnliu Rolls⁸ records thet the Bishop, as Treasurer, was
made guardian 01 the Manor 01 Rosamound, late the property 01
John de Benstede, deceased.

It will be remembered that Baldock, the Chaucellor 01 Edward
11, when put upon his trial with Despenser at Herelord in the
previous November, had been claimed by Orleton asa member oi
the Ghurch, and put into the Bishop's prison. When he came up

to London, early in the new year, the Bishop decided to have
Baldock brought alter him, with the intention 01 having him tried
by an Ecclesiastico] Gourt, At the end 01 January, therefore, the
prisoner was brought to London, and placed under guard in the
Bishop’s house at Montalt.l The Bailiils 01 London, however,
