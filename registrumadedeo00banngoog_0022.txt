ness and incapacity, by the curse 01 tho dying Templars-to
follow one another on tha throne in miserable and inglorious

sovereignty. John XXII, ruling tham, and Franco through them,
and alternately indulging and snubbing tha faeble English King,
was 1100 10 devote his best energias 10 the taak 01 humbling the
Emperor-a task, however, which he 1011 01111 unaccomplished at

his death.

It was soon recognised in England that Orleton was a special
1010111110 with the new Pope, and the list 01 applicante tc him
to use his influence on their behalt is a long ona. In the early
part 01 the year 1317 he seems to have been continuously occupied
in obtaining granta. The King writes 10 him on Dec. 25, 1316,¹
urging him 10 do everything possible 1ο secure the success oia
mission he is sending 10 the Pcpe in the spring—the Bishops 01
Norwioh and Ely, with the Earl 01 Pembroke and Lord Badles-
¹ mere, were the envoys. Their business was thraelold-to obtain
a grant 01 the Holy Land Tenth 101 the King, to secure absolution
for Edward from his oath to observa the Ordinances,¹¹ and, in the
matter 01 the cese, 1ο satisly tha Popo, who, in a mandata issuod
on Nov. 18, 1316, had demanded the arrears 101 twenty-six years.
They obtained the Tenth, but failed 10 secure 101 the King abso-
101100 from his ooth. Aa to tha cess, Pembroke and Badlesmere,
on April 1, paid 1,000 marks 101 the year 1311100 “in the
chamber 01 Cardinal de Pel, and in the presence 01 Adam do
Orleton,'' swore, on behalt 01 tha King, 10 pay the arrears, in four
yearly instalments. Within a lortnight 01 this date, Orleton is
instrumental in procuring no less than twelve Papal letters 01
provision 10 various prelerments in England. Of these, we need
only mention, as rolating to our diocese, a (lanonry 01 Heretord⁸
