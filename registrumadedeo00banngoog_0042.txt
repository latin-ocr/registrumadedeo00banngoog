Mortimcr's escape. xxix

treated, says Blaneforde,¹ minus civiliter quem decuit, and the
uncle was now too infirm to attempt the perils of an escape ;' .
it was decided, therefore, that the younger Mortimer alone should
rislr the venture. 'l'he anangements lor the flight were made by
Orleton with his accustomed diligence and thoroughness‚ and
with absolute secreey. On the night ol Aug. 1, beneath the walls
oi the Tower, a boat was ready, in which Mortimer, drngging
his guarda, crossed the Thamas: then two attendants, with
horses, took him to the sea, where a vessel was in waiting, in
which he orossed to Franco. As showing how completely our
view, both ol Mortimer and Orleton, is darhened by the sinister
shadow ol the King’s death, and by the persistent malignity oi
De la Moore, it is interesting to study the account given of this
escape by Henry de Blaneforde.⁸ He wrote actually in this year
1324, when both the escape and Orleton's trial were on all men's
tongues. Hence his opinion is ol special valne, as representing
the way in which the occurrence struck at least one contempor-
ary. So lar from blaming Orleten for contriving the ssight,
Blansfords, following out the suggestion ol the date (Aug. 1 is
the Festival ol St. Peter ud vincalo), compares Mortimer’s escape
ιο that ol the Apostle himself, angelo drwentc; and, twice again,
hs refers the success of the flight ιο God’s special aid.

As may be imagined, the King's anger against-or, perhaps,
more correctly, the King’s fear ol—the Bishop was not abated when
he heard of the escape, which he well knew to be of Orleton's
contriving though, oi course, he could not prove it. Already‚ on
April 1, he had written to the Pope a lull account of the trial,
alleging the Bishop‘s refusal to plead as his justificatior for seizing
the temporalities. 'Phe Pope replied that Orleton had served the
King well at the Papal Gourt, and it is surprising that he should
now have incurred the King's hatred. It must he due rather to
the evil tongues ol detractore than to the Bishop’s fault, and he
therefore prays the King to treat him with clemency. The Pope
wrote also to Hugh Despenser the younger, urging him to inter·
cede with the King on the Bishop’s behalf. Further, writing to
