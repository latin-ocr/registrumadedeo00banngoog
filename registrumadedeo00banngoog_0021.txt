ceses. It was usual to obtain from the Pope, on payment 01 a
small fes, a dispensation permitting this irregularity. Orleton's
dispensation (dated 16 Κ11. Dec„ 1316) allows him to retain all
his preferments on payment “before next Easter” of the first-
fruits of Acle. ·

At 1111, 11 August, 1316, the Cardinals, reassembled at Lyons,

elected 11 Pope Jacquee Deuse, (lardinal Bishop 01 Porto, and,
before that, 01 Avigncn. In the latter capacity, as Bishop of
Avignon, he had been practically Secretary of State to the pre·
vious Pope, his unique knowledge 01 civil and canon law rendering
his decision final 011 111 legal points. He made his solemn entry
into Avignon, as Pope John XXII, on Oct. 2. This appointment
made an immense difference 11 Orleton’s position and prospecte,
for the new Pope had known and valued Orleton since 1310.

and ability 01 the young English diplomat. And now, 011 111

auditor ia curia.¹ The rapacity, the unblushing simony, and the
open immorality of the Avignon Popes, in their splendid vassalage
to Franco, had not yet become a bye·word in Europe. It was
later in the century that the English Parliament branded the
Papal 00111 11’“ 11 peccherouse 0116 d’Avenon.” John XXII, the

rapacious also and grasping, though 101 101 himself. He was prc-
foundly convinced that the temporal power throughout the world
belonged, by right divine, 10 111 Roman Pontiff. With him the

Papacy at Anagni, and winning for it the sovereignty 01 the
