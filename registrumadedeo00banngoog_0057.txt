sarcastic lines quoted by Wharton,¹ does not apply in this case,
as far as the Bishoprics in themselves are concemcd. For, though
Herelord was one 011110 poorest Sees in England, yet, according
10 the Toxotio ecclesiactica, Worcester was little more valuable:
there is, indeed, reason 10 believe that it was actually 01 lese total
value. The Toxotio returns the temporalitios 01 Herelord 01
3449 70. ad. (with nubilio to the value 01 33 50. 0d.), and the
temporalitiss 01 Worcester at 2485 120. ssd. But it would almost
seem, from an entry in the Swinfield Register,¹ that various iterns
were omitted in the Toxotio, which would raiae the value 01 tho

With the appointment 10 Worccstcr must end our detailed
account 01 Bishop 0110100. We can only give a hasty sketch 01
the last eighteen years of his long and busy 1110. 10 001.,1328, 01
the Parliament 01 Salisbury, there came 00 open breach with
Stratiord. He, acting 101 Henry 01 Lancaster, bittcrly attached
Mortimer, who, as a matter 01 000100, was supported by Orleton
and Burghersh. Early next year (Feb. 16, 1329), Orleton's 00οζ
viction in the mcmorablc trial 01 1324 was annulled-on technical
grounds only, for nowhere does the Bishop deny that he helped
Mortimer. On the sams day the temporalities 01 the See were
declared 10 have been wrongly taken lrom him, and the arrears
01 income were ordered to be made over 10 him.⁴ The Bishop
continued to go abroad 00 the King's business, 0000 or twice a
year, during all the time that he held the See 01 Worccster: nor
did the fall 01 Mortimer, in 1330, cause him to lose the King’s
favour. He became very intimate also with Philip VI. 01 Franco,
00 several missione to his court; and on Dec. 1, 1333, John XXII
(a lew months only before his death), adprecor repis Francia,⁵
translated Orleton to Winchester, vacant by the appointment 01
Stratiord to the Arohbishopric. The English King, who had
intended to give the prelerment to a relative 01 William de Monta-

years before, was annoyed. Taking advantage 01 the roynl dis-
