The leading os tte Quem xxxv

ments were made, on both sides of the channel, with the same
business-like thoroughness as Orleton had shown in the rescue of
Mortimer. Both before and after the Queen’s landing we can
perceive inber course of action the boldness, the promptitudo, and
the adroitness which, always and everywhere, characterised the
Bishop's handiworlr. Thanlvs to his elever management, the Queen’e
party, even before she arrived, embraced all the leading men in
the kingdom. For, with marvellous dexterity, he reconciled the
various opposing interests which the weakness of Edward’s govern-
ment had allowed to grew up among the Barons, and united them
in a common balred of the Despensers, and a common loyalty to
the Queen over the water.

There could now no longer be any doubt of an approaching
invasion, and Edward spent the spring and summer of 1326 in
purposeless procecdings which resembled rather the struggles of a
drowning man than the preparatione of alring to crush a rebel force.

It must be remembcred that through all this time the Queen again
and again declared her perfect willingness to return to her husband
if Hugh Desponser were removed from power. The Pope himself
wrote tc Desponser on March 30, 1326, urging him to retire. But
Desponser, characteristioally‚ preferred to ruin the King rather than

promote the peaceful return of the Queen. At length, on Sept. 24, V
Isabella, with John of Hainault and his little force of only 2700
men, landed near Harwioh. She made a triumphal progress,
rather than a warlike march, through the land. The great nobles,
and even the King’s brothers, joined her at once, as did, of course,
Orleton and Burghersh; while the other bishops-including even
Reynolds himself, after a characteristic piece of folly, in u pre-
tended excommunication-sent large supplies of money by the
hands of these tw0.¹ Marching by Bury St. Edmunds and Gum-
bridge‚ they came to Oxford, where the Queen laid her case before
the University in the famous sermon preached by Bishop Orleton
cnthe text—as Dela Moora alleges—Caput arcum doleo.¹ Quum
auctoritatem, proceeds the vindictive knight of Swinbrook, ad talam
drmit questionem quod ariserendum joret rwceaaario caput heopurdum

l-De la liuore (ρ. 303) says that. immediately after the landing, the processiset the
uvaders were laid before the assembied Lords by the Bishon of llereford (proditor
facundus he calls him) who shewed that it was expedient for the Realm that the ilina
should be restrained. and the Queen appenaed bv having her will performed on the Deaoensers.

2—111dngs,iv.1e. This wne the text on which Stratiord addreseed the Parfiament
on dan. 14, 1327. lt is entirely in keeoing with De la Moore's elio-shod inaccuracv that he
should have confused the two armona.
