Orlctoc 110110 Bisbop of Herefcrd. xi

Before this letter could reach Avigncn,¹ Orleton, though scarcely
yet convalescent from a severe illness which, in April, had inter·
rupted his work, had been consecrated, on May 22, by Nicholas
Albertini, Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia. Thomas Oobham, the elect
01 Worcester, was consecrated with him. Since Avignou in sum·
mer, rinc 00111001110010, was not considered good for oue in his
state of health, he was allowed to leave the Papal Court at once,
without even taking the oath of fealty to the Pope? Before leaving,
however, he managed to secure, oi the five preferments he was
vacating‚ two for members of his family. Thomas de Orleton
obtained the Rectory 01 11011,ι and John de Orleton, already Canon
of Herefcrd, secured the Prebeud of Wells. Wotton went to a
foreign cardinal, Bertrand, of St. Mary's iu Aquiro.

Reaabing Englaud before the end cf June, Orleton, on the
30th, made his profession of obedience to the Archbishop, coram
magno citari c'c ccclesia Contaminari curn prmcseicnc solemni in
priato (1100010110, and on July 2, 11 Lambeth, he received the
spirituales cf the See at the hands 011110 Archbishop. The King,
who was already accustomed to have his requests ignored by the
new Pope, soon forgave the infringement of the “rights of the
crown.'’ Moreover, since Orleton was now probably the ablest
cf English diplomatists, and was known tc be a special favourite
with John XXII, his services could scarcely be dispensed with. So
Edward accepted the situation, and allowed him to receive the
temporalities, at Nottingham, on July 21.Ι The enthronement
at Hereford did not take place until Oct. 1, the Sunday after
Michaelmas Day.

When Orleton returned to Eugland as Bishop of Herefcrd, the
condition cf the country was lamentable in the extreme. Nine
years before, scon after Edward’s accession, Walter Stapledon,
Bishop of Exoter, friend to the King though hs was, and fated in
the end to die for him, had written tc a foreign Gardinal, Pessima
